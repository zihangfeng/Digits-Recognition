# Digits-Recognition

  In this project, I simply use the neural network to train the representation of a digit and use the net to test the data. FANN is a good and easy tool to accomlish this task and the outcome can reach about 80% accurate. FANN does provide a few algorithms, such as, back probagations, to train the data. The required methods to change the parameters of those methodes are also given in the library. of course, the parameters of those algorithm contains its own default parameters. However, for some cases, it is required to change the parameters in order to increase the accuacy.
